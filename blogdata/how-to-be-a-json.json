    "content":"The term dodo is often used metaphorically, typically referring to someone acting in a foolish or outdated manner. However, if you're referring to the extinct bird, the dodo, being a dodo isn't something one can literally become, as it was a unique species native to Mauritius. The dodo became a symbol for obsolescence and extinction due to its disappearance in the late 17th century, often attributed to human activity. If you're using the term in a metaphorical sense and want to avoid being seen as a dodo, it generally means staying informed, adaptable, and open to new ideas, avoiding outdated or ineffective practices.",
